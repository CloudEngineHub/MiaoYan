## Why do this

- I have tried many note-taking applications before, such as WizNote, Ulysses, Quiver, MWeb, Bear, Typora, for various reasons, I did not find a conventional Markdown application, so I had the idea of doing MiaoYan.
- My job is front-end development, but also can develop iOS App, love to toss new things, so develop MiaoYan as a fun leisure.
