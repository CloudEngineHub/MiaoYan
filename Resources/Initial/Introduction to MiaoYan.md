## MiaoYan PPT

1. New users will have templates generated by default upon initialization. If you are an existing user upgrading to 1.0, you can copy [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/MiaoYan/master/Resources/Initial/%E5%A6%99%E8%A8%80%20PPT.md) to MiaoYan to try it out.
2. Execute `command + option + p` to start MiaoYan PPT preview, or right-click on a selected document and choose `MiaoYan PPT` to open.

4. You can use HTML to customize effects. For more complex usage, please refer to the [Reveal](https://revealjs.com/markdown/) documentation.

## Why do this

- I have tried many note-taking applications before, such as WizNote, Ulysses, Quiver, MWeb, Bear, Typora, for various reasons, I did not find a conventional Markdown application, so I had the idea of doing MiaoYan.
- My job is front-end development, but also can develop iOS App, love to toss new things, so develop MiaoYan as a fun leisure.

## Support

- I have two cats, one is called TangYuan, and one is called Coke, If you think MiaoYan makes your life better, you can give my cats [feed canned food 🥩🍤](https://miaoyan.app/cats.html).
- If you like MiaoYan, you can star it in Github. We are more welcome to recommend them to your like-minded friends.
