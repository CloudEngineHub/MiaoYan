## Text Formatting

**Alice** was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her *sister* on the bank, and of having ***nothing*** to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.

~~She thought~~ "And what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?"

Suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

Alice found herself falling down a `very deep well`.

H~2~O is what Alice might have encountered in her adventures.

The tea party happened on the 26^th^ day of the month.

## Code

### Alice's growth potion recipe

```python
def alice_potion(size_change):
    """
    Calculate Alice's new size based on what she consumes
    """
    current_size = 1.0  # Normal size
    
    if size_change == "DRINK ME":
        new_size = current_size * 0.1  # Shrink to 1/10th
        print(f"Alice shrinks to {new_size} of her normal size!")
    elif size_change == "EAT ME":
        new_size = current_size * 10  # Grow 10 times larger
        print(f"Alice grows to {new_size} times her normal size!")
    
    return new_size

# Alice's adventure
alice_potion("DRINK ME")  # Output: Alice shrinks to 0.1 of her normal size!
```

The Cheshire Cat appeared when Alice typed: `console.log("We're all mad here!");`

---

## Math and Formulas

The White Rabbit was always concerned about time. His pocket watch showed the equation:

$$\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$$

Alice's size changes can be expressed as:

$S_{new} = S_{original} \times k$

Where $k$ is the transformation coefficient:

- For "DRINK ME": $k = 0.1$
- For "EAT ME": $k = 10$

The probability of Alice finding her way back home:

$$P(\text{home}) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\text{adventure}(t)}}$$

## Blockquotes

Alice pondered the Cheshire Cat's wisdom:

> "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
>
> "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here.
> I'm mad. You're mad."
>
> "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.
>
> "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."

The Mad Hatter shared his philosophy:

> Why is a raven like a writing desk?
>> Alice gave up. "I give up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?"
>>> "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
