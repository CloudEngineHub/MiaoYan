# MiaoYan - Claude AI Assistant Development Guide

## Project Overview

MiaoYan (å¦™è¨€) is a lightweight macOS Markdown editor built with Swift 5 + AppKit. Features a three-panel layout: sidebar + file list + editor.

## ðŸŽ¯ Claude Development Principles

### Core Philosophy

- **Incremental Improvements** > Major Refactoring
- **Understand First** > Implement Immediately  
- **Pragmatism** > Dogmatism
- **Clear Intent** > Clever Code

### Development Workflow

1. **Analysis Phase**: Use Grep/Read to analyze relevant code and understand existing patterns
2. **Planning Phase**: Break down tasks into 3-5 steps using TodoWrite
3. **Implementation Phase**: Small iterative changes, modify one file at a time
4. **Verification Phase**: Ensure code compiles and functions work correctly

### â›” Absolute Prohibitions

- **NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by user**
- Never commit non-compiling code
- Don't make unverified assumptions
- **Stop after 3 consecutive failures** - reassess the approach

### âœ… Must Follow

- Keep every commit in a working state
- Learn patterns from existing implementations
- Maintain consistent code style throughout

## Project Structure

```
Mac/
â”œâ”€â”€ View/           # UI Components (*View.swift, *Controller.swift)
â”œâ”€â”€ Business/       # Business Logic (Note.swift, Storage.swift)
â”œâ”€â”€ Helpers/        # Utilities (UserDefaultsManagement.swift)
â”œâ”€â”€ Extensions/     # Swift Extensions
â””â”€â”€ Images.xcassets/# Image and Color Resources
```

## Swift macOS Development Best Practices

### Code Standards

- Follow existing project conventions and use established utility classes
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Prefer self-documenting code over extensive comments
- Retrieve colors from `Images.xcassets`
- Use `NSLocalizedString` for internationalization

### AppKit Guidelines

- Use `NSViewController` lifecycle methods appropriately
- Implement proper delegate patterns for UI components
- Handle keyboard shortcuts with either NSEvent or KeyboardShortcuts framework
- Use Auto Layout constraints for responsive UI
- Follow MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns

### Performance Considerations

- Use `DispatchQueue.main.async` for UI updates
- Implement lazy loading for expensive operations
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately
- Use weak references to prevent retain cycles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Use `guard` statements for early returns
- Implement proper error handling with `do-catch` blocks
- Add meaningful `print()` statements for debugging complex flows
- Use `assert()` for development-time checks

## Error Recovery

**3-Strike Rule**: Stop after 3 consecutive failures and reassess approach.

## Important Reminders

**Pragmatism > Perfectionism**  
**Working Simple Solutions > Complex Designs**

- Always understand existing code before implementing
- Ensure compilation success after each modification
- Use TodoWrite to track task progress
- Revert to working state immediately when encountering issues
- When in doubt, choose the simpler, more maintainable approach

## Development Commands
