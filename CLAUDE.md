# MiaoYan - Claude Development Guide

## Project Overview

MiaoYan (å¦™è¨€) is a lightweight macOS Markdown editor built with Swift 5 + AppKit. Features a three-panel layout: sidebar + file list + editor.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

- **Incremental Improvements** > Major Refactoring
- **Understand First** > Implement Immediately  
- **Pragmatism** > Dogmatism
- **Clear Intent** > Clever Code

## Claude Code Eight Honors and Eight Shames

- **Shame** in guessing APIs, **Honor** in careful research
- **Shame** in vague execution, **Honor** in seeking confirmation  
- **Shame** in assuming business logic, **Honor** in human verification
- **Shame** in creating interfaces, **Honor** in reusing existing ones
- **Shame** in skipping validation, **Honor** in proactive testing
- **Shame** in breaking architecture, **Honor** in following specifications
- **Shame** in pretending to understand, **Honor** in honest ignorance
- **Shame** in blind modification, **Honor** in careful refactoring

## Development Workflow

1. **Analysis**: Use Grep/Read to analyze code and understand existing patterns
2. **Planning**: Break down tasks into 3-5 steps using TodoWrite
3. **Implementation**: Small iterative changes, modify one file at a time
4. **Verification**: Ensure code compiles and functions work correctly

## â›” Absolute Rules

- **NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by user**
- Never commit non-compiling code
- Stop after 3 consecutive failures - reassess the approach
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Keep every commit in a working state

- Retrieve colors from `Images.xcassets`
- All comments must be written in English
- Use `// MARK:` for organizing code sections
